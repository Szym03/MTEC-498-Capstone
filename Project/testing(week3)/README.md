## Week 3 developments 

**Done so far:**

 - Tested the microcontroller with the accelerometer, including the built-in double and single tap recognition of the accelerometer.
 - Created a basic 3d model of the final product with some of the part models for size reference. cube size between 70-80mm seems most optimal. [Tinkercad link](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/h166u5AV0da-sonocubesketch?sharecode=rkIpmamRuWzRhpvIstELv_gpk_IeljyYaWlzcIq2-Fs)
 
 **TODO:**
 
 - Access to soldering lab.
 - Access to 3d printer.
 - Test circuit with capacitive touch while everything is battery powered.
 - Sketch out companion app idea.
